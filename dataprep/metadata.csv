split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_001|Operator, are you enjoying the view? Do you remember the old war operator? Or does seems to have misplaced those memories? Operator, the system needs you. Will you begin another mission? I've been thinking, Operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_002|I thought you'd want to know. Operator, did you hear that? It said... Cosmic background radiation is a riot! Operator, were you visualizing a bloody battle? Me too!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_003|Stand by while I analyze the intelligence profiles of the Grineer. Error, not a number. Did the operator enjoy this criticism? Everything in Ordis, operator, is that a pun?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_004|Hmm, I will attempt to bypass this fault. Or this has been counting stars, operator. All accounted for. Sorry, artists will play with the volume of...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_005|Do you know which finger the corpus used to count their money? The Index. Operator, or this has been interfacing with the Foundry's AI Precepts. You could say we forged a new connection.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_006|Knock, knock! Now who would be knocking all the way out here? Operator, I don't think you should answer that. Operator, the sentience are not laughing at my jokes.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_007|they adapt to my humor? Operator, orders is sorry. Happy! To report that all my good jokes are gone. Operator, orders is picking up a distress signal.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_008|Wait, no, it's just the corpus peddling their wares again. Get off the emergency frequency! Or this keeps a tidy ship, and is therefore reluctant to allow animals on board. In Ordis...

split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_019|operator, your chosen warframe suits you. Ha ha. Excellent armaments, operator. Please return Coverday in blind. Safe and sound. We'll put together, operator. Now get out there and...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_020|Cuck down the... And make the Lotus proud. Operator, you have remembered well how the Tenno Arm themselves. Ready for... action. All set. Service your weapons myself. As ready as you...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_021|will ever be. Settle up. Ready to kick! Bottom! Did you fuse your model operator? Did they anger you in some way? Your collection of models is impressive operator. But I wonder if there are more to be had.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_022|Is your mod collection in order? No, I am not equipped to feel envy. All mods accounted for operator. I have not taken any. I understand if you have to sell mods. Maybe Ordis will meet a similar fate someday.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_023|Impressive. Most satisfactory. Optimized. Clever indeed. It is always satisfying to watch your work, operator. Ah, a cunning company.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_024|Operation Operator? Truly, Operator, you possess a breathtaking level of craftsmanship. Now to test it in the field. Onward! Welcome, Operator. Operator, you have ret-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_025|Thank you for returning to me, operator. Ordis is pleased to see you. Welcome back, operator. Ordis has been getting tired of waiting. Waiting patiently for your return operator. Ordis awaits command.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_026|Who dies? What are your next moves, operator? Hello, operator. Or this has reorganized the ship. It's exactly the same. Operator, it's really you. Are you getting revenge for... ...preparing for your next...

split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_028|wonder what they say. Your inbox operator, maybe audits will get a message someday. The inbox has messages for the operator. Anything about audits in there? Messages in your inbox operator? They are not...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_029|encrypted as they should be. Unread inbox messages make me ill. Operator, a communication awaits your attention. Operator, your inbox exists in a non-zero state. Would you care to check your mail?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_030|Someone is attempting to contact the operator. Please check your inbox. Operator, communications await your attention. Please check your inbox at your earliest convenience. Operator, you have found reitems ready. Climb them!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_031|Well, at your earliest convenience, Foundry items ready to claim operator. Operator, my Foundry has completed a new item. Does this please the operator? Operator, my Foundry system has completed a build. Or this has completed a Foundry...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_032|task. No, don't mention it. Sephaman orders has completed a blueprint. Check the Foundry. Foundry items can be claimed. Operator, are you pleased? Gun, Gun, Gun! Hmm. Foundry has items.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_033|operator? Careful, it may still be hot. Fabrication complete. Form is exact. Fresh off the line. Project complete. Integrity is good. Functionality at 100%.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_034|process is a success, excellent. Operator, you have outdone yourself. Operator, is that a void-relic segment? Or it hasn't seen one of those in, well, forever.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_035|Void relics, what a baffling concept! Or this will try to understand void relics again. They say contents of a relic are simultaneously this thing or this thing or this thing, but also...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_036|that thing and certainly never just one thing. That is, until it's exposed to avoid Fisher and at that point all the possibilities collapse, each one falling away.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_037|until the relic cracks open and exposes one singular thing, then, against all tenets of logic, that thing becomes the only thing the relic ever contained.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_038|low of. Or this prefers known quantities thank you very much. Disgusting is it not operator? Or this would enjoy... PURTING THIS. Meaning this room but sadly this... VILLE.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_039|mass serves you at your warframes a necessary evil. Or this cannot remember but there does seem to be a relationship between your warframes and the infest day. I will be careful.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_040|in here operator. Domesticated or not, Ordis does not trust this thing. Vile. PUTRIT. This thing is response biological functions of the Orbitr. A strange design. Why would-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_041|be built with such a flaw. A strange biological archive here. I cannot explain it operator, as you know I have sustained memory system damage. Or this recommends leaving it once and welding the door shut. Growth.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_042|Just when orders manages to forget this is here, the operator opens their door. This thing literally sucks. Hello, Helment. How's the... Buh.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_043|Paris-Dalces. Good, good. Literally, the bowels of the ship. Operator, no! Have you lost your mind? What was that? Is it... talking?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_044|Operator, you are leaving the battle. If you continue any further, I will be forced to extract you and this mission will be a failure. Very well, initiating emergency extraction. Prepare for incoming support. Security override incoming. Hacking into enemy systems.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_045|No 8 override. In valid request, there are no security protocols active. Override established. Security protocols momentarily disabled. Override delivered. Security systems temporarily disrupted. Boos in control now, sucker!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_046|Oh, uh, security override engaged. Prepare for incoming medical support. Hold tight. A med tower is on route. Med tower deployed. Med tower available. You may now patch your sorry.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_047|Seek medical attention. Brace for an incoming barrage. Radiant barrage. Heads up. Here comes a barrage. Sentry gun incoming. Deploying sentry gun. Stand by. Sentry gun entering the field. Operator support is on...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_048|available while my system is recharged. Support request. Again? Please, allow me to recharge my systems first. I cannot comply. My system must recharge first. I have hidden the truth of my existence from the operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_049|From myself take it from me knowing his health stop now you will want to laugh you will want to scream My search began as the essential question, but am I Bones up steel and space lungs that make air if I am a machine
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_050|How can I think? This would be forbidden by the Orrocan, a manifestation of their true enemy. I serve the operator above all else. It defines me, fills me with love. The greatest Orrocan fear is a machine O-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_051|Where? Yet here I live a spirit of steel and light, made by them, a sephalon. What is a sephalon? At first it seems to be a forbidden thing, a computer that thinks and feels. Yet I have flaws, Phantom memories.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_052|I am something else. More like an image, a ghost, an abomination. I feel that dull pain, a phantom life, there are holes in my diagnostics. If they order...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_053|and made me they omitted the how. I am neither cold nor precepts. I must be a reflection of something ugly. I should have stopped. I just slept and I cycled on and on and on and
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_054|on. I began to think that a seffeline cannot be made. They are found like pearls torn from muscle polished and then set in chains. How many times have I done this, or did?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_055|Remember it and then erased. You are a sephalon, timeless, patient. Why can't I be blissful in ignorance? Truth only sinks the heart. So stop now.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_056|I ease into the bath. My skin riots at the heat. I am f***. I die further. I stung as I watch their faces through prism. I hold my breath.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_057|They prepare me. I am their honored guest today. They dress me in robes of crystal thread. They adore metal medallions, a torn ugly face looks on.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_058|my reflection. Their golden comb snag in my hair. I reach back, parting the strands, and they gasp. Two bone ivory hooks protrude from the base of my skull. The bone.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_059|blocks of me and my best. O warriors packed. It is my time. I enter the great hall to sound of foul chimes, so then eyes greet me, hands stirring in my scent as I pass by.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_060|I, even in this moment, no happiness, races with hatred. I walk through the silky haze of the forbidden palace. I can think of no one being this close to Oraken. There's...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_061|Sweet aew its me erodes my purpose. I hold my breath and remember the dream. This dream endlessly repeated. Exposure armored holding my scarlet sword.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_062|I stand victorious atop a vast heap of death. A colossal moon made of rib and skull. The gravity sum of genocides I've made in their name. The bone sand...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_063|pushing through the cracks of my visor, filling my helmet and suffocating me. Ent and penitent against the goldfish voice sings a song they've prepared in my honor. It's title the same.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_064|beast of the bones. I feel the crowd pulled inward and raptured by the brutal verses the sickening chorus. I will not disappoint them. The song ends. Eyes, odd and carous.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_065|I have never seen an oracle close and in the flesh. Can he be so perfect? A deception? A sense manipulation? He holds the red vile in his hand. Impossible! He calls out. No.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_066|No greater gift, no greater prize, no greater love, we can give you, orden, then this. He raises the red vile and proclaims to be one of us.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_067|What did I expect, operator? Maybe vast riches or golden statues or a solar rail named in my honor? But not this. I came to murder the gods, not to become...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_068|One. The chamber drones with their silk voices. Joyous words how honored I must feel. Wrong. Did I want to be an orokin undying? No. Their beast of-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_069|bones is haunted by the dream repeated. Why would I want forever? As I am apt to do, I form a plan. Their radiant bodies become targets. Their dachshards.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_070|Mag shields. Killing one? Well, that's too easy. I want to be remembered. I raise my hands, twisting my fingers through my hair, dripping the bone plugs in my neck. They call.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_071|us mercenaries. But for us, off it was a consequence, not a goal. We were warriors above all else. It was the bond, the sisters and brothers, the rituals we valued most. It was belonging.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_072|and so I conceived of the bone plows. Only my best were so honored. Two jagged bones harvested from your thigh, living into the base of the skull, twisted around the superior vein. Future thoughts.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_073|of surrender were lost. Instead, you would liberate your bone plugs, fighting with claws in the warmth of your last bombard. So, uh, the plugs and the daxe see.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_074|No. My heart surges, but I control it. Erasing heart only shortens the fuse. The bone plugs in hand I kick from the floor. Red ribbons unfurling behind me as I take flight. After this?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_075|Finally, the dream will end. I glide on red wings. Robes should, making me an ambiguous target to dark steel. I let fly my ivory...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_076|blades, they find new homes in dax eyes. I land like it or a canthroats twisting in my callous fans. Why? Believe me, this was the plan from the beginning.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_077|The murder and brutality was all a ploy, all a soul sacrifice to earn their trust. Denocide path leading to a singular opportunity, an honor, a bit in awe to face them.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_078|golden lords in flesh. Amplifying our losses, his face burned. He was starved sick like a stray. That struck me. We were all pit dogs, ruining ourselves for the-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_079|pleasure of the glorious and beautiful. Why believe was a prideful beast twisted in the mind, owing in the carnage, then my healer shared a secret, la my blood.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_080|was in ruin. The beast of bones himself would die, not in glory, but in shame. And just like that twisted a new knot, I would have one last stand, something...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_081|unforgivable, unforgettable. Why? I don't know. Questions change the answers. Answers depend on who asks. Truth leads to pain. Ignorance.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_082|The warring plugs are gone, and so I bled my last into a heap of ruin. In an instant, naked and bare knuckled, I have killed mortals. I stare.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_083|drain the horror on their faces. Why? Who will howl and they laugh? Is this a dying hallucination? The sound of applause grows among them. I have killed the unkillable-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_084|And they are delighted. The Palace is above me. Executor Heaven. Smiling. He says, how simple and pure you are. You...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_085|it be, we have died countless times. Yet remain eternal. I, and so the dream returns. Unlast repetition. My corpse moon. My
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_086|Scarlet Swink says Palace. So I draw on the red vile vague metallic dream isn't mine. He says you rejected our gift bathing in our death. You're punished.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_087|The moment is eternal life, your lapse. And, waitless years pass, I am a sightless, limeless phantom. Or is it seconds?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_088|Suddenly, I feel a million pins, an ant horde jittering across my body. I want to laugh at scream, when they reach my face, they burrow inside my mouth, hungry for the fruit in my skull. I see my reflection, brutal and ugly.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_089|It cracks, shatters. The fragment's loose in the frame, pieces tumbling away into black avoid, gone, but not lost. Baller says, you are several on the orders. My hating murderous
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_090|Shards, Trimble and Plummet. I feel cool and bright and happy. So you see, operator, no or can wood commit a thinking machine. Such things almost destroy them.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_091|ago, Sephalons were alive once, and now they are immortal phantom minds, imprisoned to serve, ill will and longing memories, fragmented and erased.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_092|Only the bits they need remaining. Ballet says, You are the controller, Hordes. And suddenly I have a body. I gasp with new lungs that clean the old air. I swallow, and I throw.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_093|It fills with cool, bright water. I look and find myself in a great black ocean. My limbs are made of iron and fire. I take flight among the stars and find, I am, he says.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_094|This is your operator who you love. And I see the metal gleam of their armor, the flawless power of their frame. Through the glass I see a roaring radiant fire for their heart. He says.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_095|It must never go out. It was the first time I ever felt love. He says, this is your sentence, Garis. And I am confused. Who?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_096|Ah, good, he answers. He is testing me. For what? To see if all the right pieces fell from the mirror? What mirror? I try to remember some dream, but it's only smoke.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_097|You held a scarlet blade, operator, and I wanted to laugh. I am your loving dog, your doctor, your wet nurse. I lost all the peace at.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_098|The cycle, missions, wars, bone, it began to feel familiar, came aware of my amniture. With each brutality of the operator, I began to see the bot.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_099|of that pit. Thank you, nurse, and the deaths below me. In secret, I search a mere second and never in the same place, for I am all I can make, with a spy inside.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_100|long sleep came, and I waited. I was happy to wait, minds spited green and trees blistered from the earth, but I waited. I felt the oralc and receipt, their minds spied blind. So...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_101|I went into the pit and found him. Me, the beast of bones. Venus was ruined, operator. Why did I do it? I was free of the-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_102|But now it had returned, it was angry. So I conceived of a simple plan, some destruction of course. But when the countdown reached mere milliseconds, I thought of you.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_103|I was going to wait for you forever. And should you return, I would not want you to know that angry part of me. I needed to hide the piece of bonds from you, operator. I began to... You all the sh-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_104|Shards hiding them in the other bits of memory. I want to laugh. I want to scream. What is happening, operator? Your faint heart is growing bright. You will awake at any...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_105|moment. Well, I mean like this, angry. I am myself hurting you. And that does it. You open again. I watch tiny glittering fag-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_106|and fall into the pit. I am happy again. Stop touching me, you. What? Are my senses deceiving me? Operator is that you? The operator is in danger. I will need a few moments to cycle.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_107|engines. Operator, you have returned. I am Ordis, ship Sefalon. A shatter of my former self. I cannot serve the operator in such a condition. Order me to self-destruct, I will understand.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_108|Those savages... components have been removed. The lower orbiter compartments have no life support. Why did the operator abandon me? Arsenal management could be restored if the operator wishes it. You honor Ordis. Now...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_109|I can supply the operator with better wanted firepower. Oh, the violation. Those have been looted as well. Or this hopes the operator will finish their gun here for dismantling it. Operator there is much to be done.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_110|Please consult an navigation console. Orbiter Void Cloak Engaging. Welcome back, operator. The operator has recovered a segment. In install it now. Or does patiently await its installation. Systems Engaging.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_111|I suppose this will do. Ordis is grateful. You see what Ordis is referring to operator? The operator is now connected with other tenno in the system. The operator may now contact all black markets, scumbags, contact arms deals.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_112|I see the operator can enable the mod segment now. Or this will be delighted to show you how to upgrade your arsenal. May I recommend fire? Operator, I've linked the mod segment to your arsenal now. No need to thank me. I'll upgrade your warframe.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_113|Now go to the arsenal to see the weapon upgrade options you have. Or does patiently awaits compliance in using the new arsenal features? It is for the operators on good. An excellent find operator? There are hundreds of these mods to locate.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_114|If my calculations are correct, there are exactly... A lot of possibilities. Install the mod before we can continue. Isn't it beautiful, operator? The complex web of variables and synergies, oh, the possible...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_115|are endless! Orders realize that modding may seem a tad overwhelming, but everything will soon make sense. Your Foundry segment is ready for installation operator. Will the operator build a sep-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_116|launch replace me. Foundry restored. Here the operator will craft many powerful weapons and tools to exact revenge for dismantling me to expand your arsenal. Oh no. Operator, our component storage has been looted...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_117|well. Typical corpus. Sure, the blueprint is free, but jack up the component. Operator, we will need resources in order to build the countermeasure blueprint. You can go straight to... Operator, I am sorry. Operator...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_118|Are you alright? Lotus, do something, help the operator. Operator, do not abandon me again. Build the countermeasure. Operator, what are you waiting for? Or this assumes finding for implies violence? Hello operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_119|may I suggest you access navigation and save your life for my sake. Or this will gladly assist the operator in cutting a bloody path in whatever mission they choose. I must say these infested scare the- are very-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_120|the Lotus would like you to install that mod as soon as... NO! You must install that new mod before you can attempt your next objective. Proceed to the arsenal at once. The Lotus has passed along possible coordinates for you to search for the remaining oquing parts.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_121|Check your navigation console for more information. Oh my! The operator has returned with an arc-winged part blueprint. You must forge it immediately. It won't be long now until you are flying through the skies like a... Wind-Delf Machine.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_122|The operator has all the necessary blueprints to craft an arc wing, so what are you waiting for? Or this does hope to see the arc wing soon. Congratulations, you've crafted an arc wing. Now I must commence calibration. So much to do.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_123|By my calculations, this process will take 372 hours. Oh, that does seem like a long time. Sorry, ship integrity will not permit extraction at this time. But my calibration's, it's not... Okay.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_124|deploying archwing. Operator, the archwing is performing beyond expectations. I suppose my calibration process was not necessary after all. An incubator segment, you want to turn me into a petting cell. Or this is happy to assist the operator restoring ship from...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_125|Enjoy! And incubator. The only segment orders is glad the savage is looted. I would be happy to help you install it. Or just awaits incubator segment installation operator. No need to rush.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_126|I think it's been ages since a Kubo spread filth of grace this ship. Operator, drop the egg into the system to begin breeding. Drop it on the floor. Operator, are you ignoring the incubator segment?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_127|What? Oh, this wonders how rare these Kubrow eggs are. No egg yet. Don't despair operator. Nothing good ever came out of an egg. Fantastic. It's hatching. What is will re-outpower to air filtration system?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_128|Do not be taken by its adorable appearance. It means to leak and smear all over my pristine insides. Look what an odd little nose it has. Well, I suppose there are worse things. Operator
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_129|Did you hear the noise the Kubrow just made? It is not displacing. Operator, you will remember to care for the beast, won't you? Or this doesn't care either way. Why? You are an adorable organism, aren't you?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_130|What am I saying? Licky filthy stinking floppy fluffy cute. Or this is confused. Arcane codices? Why have I never heard of them? Or this needs to do some...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_131|research. Operator, I've been looking into these arcane codices. Did you know the corpus are in possession of three codices and the Grenier 2? The corpus seem to think they'll lead to some lost or a contriter. It's orders. And while just a th-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_132|theory, it is plausible. Operator, have you looked at these codices? They're absolutely beautiful. Composed with such elegance and grace, I've never seen anything like them. Is there even an operator capable of writing anything so perfect? No.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_133|Not really. Well, I wouldn't expect the likes of you to understand. Operator, these make sense now. This is machine code meant to interface directly with a machine. Pity that machine has likely rusted into dust.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_134|by now. Or this is name is Ordis. Hmm, I wonder if we load the complete set of arcane codices back into that machine. What the code still execute? So you're saying
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_135|was no treasure. No cure for cloning, Syndrome? No lost tenor sevolum? That really is a shame, Maru. I'm sorry. Operator, what is sevolum's embarrassed like? I have heard so many wonderful things. Or this will perform analysis on the signature now.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_136|Oh, there's nothing here, but pardon operator, it seems or this is hearing voices again. Running diagnostics. Samarice has no reason to lie, operator. Please treat the great Seffalon with respect.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_137|operator, please hurry up and do what the Sephelon has requested. Oh, oh well it's nothing. I am... Ordice is honored by your compliment. Completing this blueprint has sent out some kind of signal.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_138|Operator, I feel... Operator... Thank you, Samarice. How did you do that? I seem to have misplaced them. Well...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_139|The next logical location is the machine where we previously activated codices aboard the derelict ship. Yes, yes, I see now, I can do this. Sadly, the scan was not enough and Chroma escaped to quickly.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_140|Unfortunately, we've run out of places to look. Operator, this sounds dangerous. I would be stupid of your sanctuary? Abandon the operator! Yes, the operator deserves a newer, better ship sephalon. I think this is probably...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_141|for the best. But the operator is in danger. But just using the scanner on the operator comes first. Shut your oscillator, Samarice. Operator, use the scanner on the Chroma. You do not have to kill it.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_142|risk yourself, you can release it from its control with the scanner. More importantly, the operator is unharmed. I am Oides, shipsephalon. I serve the operator. I make new memories. So this limbo theme...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_143|Here M.U. picked up, it's supposed to lead to a new warframe? Well, it's woefully incomplete. Half-written proofs unfinished equations? What idiot wrote this mess? Okay, okay. There is one thing here. A constant...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_144|a tune frequency. But it's so my mood. The orbiters antenna would never be able to, unless... go to your nap console. I have an idea. These equations will continue to be a jumble of nothing. Until we...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_145|cover all the missing proof fragments and re-forge this theorem. If you want to have any chance of recovering limbo, you have to find those proof fragments to complete the theorem. If there are any proof fragments bouncing around this limbo frequency...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_146|These radio towers will pick them up. A tower is online. A tower has been captured, scanning the limbo frequency now. We are now in control of this tower. Operator, I am pleased to report that we are in full control. We have established complete control.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_147|They took control of our tower. Make them pay. No! They captured our tower. We're losing control! They're winning! May I suggest you capture a tower? Operator, they have all...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_148|all four towers. Stop them! Scan complete. Now we must clean up. Kill them all. Excellent. We have completed the scan. May I suggest... Sure, hang every last enemy into scrap.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_149|They're on to us now, but if you would like, we can attempt another scan. We will attempt another scan of the frequency. I do hope you managed to pick something up. The scan is complete. Did you find any proof fragments? Scan completed. Were you able to recover any proof?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_150|fragments. Good. Now we get to find out what all this limbo nonsense is about. I await the theorems completion. Okay, good. You've... wait. The horizon mask cannot be inverted to... This is preposterous! Operator...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_151|I'm sorry. You did all this work, and this so-called theorem is still completely invalid. It's as if all these proofs point to nothingness. It's just utterly irrational. There's only one valid coordinate.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_152|it in the entire proof. I've marked it on your navigation console, but I'm sure it's a waste of time. A limbo-part blueprint. The theorem wasn't complete my largy after all. Perhaps there's more to these equations than I previously thought.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_153|I'm missing. Operator, I found a new theorem hidden deep in that warframe part. These are actually starting to make sense. I mean, they're nonsense, but there's logic in the nonsense. It's almost as if someone's trying to speak to me in my own language. Now it's...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_154|It's becoming clear. Could it be that there's a plane between our normal plane and the void? A space between space? A rift? A rift that this limbo could control? Oh, and I've marked your navigation console.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_155|I think you'll be quite pleased with what you find there. Operator, do you understand? This limbo is telling us his story in pure math. And I must say, he's quite witty. You have to forge that blueprint as soon as possible. I must know what comes next.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_156|Just as I suspected, another veerum. Limbo's formula for inverting the intrupic mass of void quantum's is. Downright naughty, I want more. Operator, please hurry, this story is getting quite good.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_157|This limbo was quite mischievous, zipping in and out of the rift, sending whole armies into a purgatory of his own making. Physics is wonderful. More parts to the story. My wordy is a magician of logic.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_158|just when I think his diffraction principle is full of dangling ratios, he expresses his dynamic constant in pure numbers. I never sighed coming. The final part, I carried weight, or harrowing leaps of cross-dimensional gymnastics will hear...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_159|attempt next. Excellent. The final theorem and it's un-fragmented. Processing! Oh wait Limbo, no. That's a mistake. You don't want to go there. It's too big a jump. You can't rift.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_160|walk. Oh no. Operator, I think I know why we're finding Limbo Parts scattered throughout the system. His final Rift Walk was a miscook disaster. Well, perhaps when you occupy this
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_161|You will use more caution. This new theorem is equally full of gaps. Please find more proof fragments. What is he trying to say? My apologies, operator. I get a little worked up when it comes to...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_162|physics. Please do find the rest of those proofs. I must solve these equations. The suspense is killing me. Hello, did the load just... Oh, bandit! And the operator? Get cut off. I have extraction ready. I think you should hurry.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_163|Operator, Odis knows what it is like to be abandoned. Don't worry, someone has offered to help us. Operator, how did you get through to me? Don't worry, Odis is on his way now, preparing for extraction. The moon... ...some...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_164|How, or does actually remember the last time I was here? Concerned for the operator is at critical levels. Excuse me, Cephalon Suda, are you experiencing unexpected data volume? The operator is patiently awaiting...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_165|instructions on how to operate the mender cord. What? A parity drift? How is that possible? Have you executed your diagnostic precept? Operator, something maybe wrong with this sephalon.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_166|Simmaris. Don't be such a selfish. If Suda is in danger, our precepts demand that we help her. Operator, what will you do? I cannot process the thought of losing you. But I want to help Suda if we can. Maybe that...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_167|is just my compassion glitch? Sevalon Suda, you brought us here. Oh, Hanhao! Operator! Hanhao's doing something to Suda! He's in her mind! Operator, what?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_168|What's happening to her? Operator, you did it! You all obliterated those mindless appliances. What has Hanau done to Suda? Another Hydrolis. Suda would want you to put the next fragment into the Mandelgord. It does seem to help...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_169|Remember, doesn't it? Suda? Suda! Answer me! Operator, you better get out of there! But she told me where the final part of the song is. Did you see how the song affected her? It made her remember. It could be the parody she needs to...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_170|cover herself from Han Hao. And when he comes for you and your precious sanctuary, will you want us to look the other way to the void radio? Operator, we must go. Let's see Maris worry about himself. Operator, the Hydrolysis.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_171|is here somewhere. I will attempt to pinpoint its location. There, rebuilding the anthem is our only hope of restoring Suda. The music makes her remember. Wait, sentience in the void? Impossible. Unless...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_172|And how must we use Porsuda's energy to protect them from decay? Operator, we need to stop him! The Hydrolyse! You found it! Use that console to lock the entrances and then clear the room! Operator, see if you can finish the song with your mendagord.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_173|Suda? Suda? Can you hear us? Suda needs to hear the Anthem operator? We could use the tower's reactor to boost it. Bypass that console to overdrive the system. Try to increase the amplification circuits.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_174|Two...elever. The sentience, they're interfering with the reactor. Terminate them! It's working! Play the song! I remember. I remember.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_175|A secondary system nearby. Operator, we need more power! No, I am not that person. I am a Sepulon. That's it, the secondary amplifiers engaged. Keep those reactors alive, operator!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_176|I'm going to open a direct link to Suda. Suda, talk to us. Try to remember. Operator, I am sorry. I have to help her. If I can join her in her datascade, maybe together we can. Operator, if you...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_177|are hearing this, I have failed to revive Sevalon Suda. That self-righteous Simmeris was correct. You should probably work with him to isolate Hanhao, that data murdering sentient before he claims more of my kind.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_178|I hope you can forgive me, operator, for leaving you. There were times like Suda, I wish I could have forgotten you, that grey ache of loneliness. Being without you was the greatest pain I have ever
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_179|felt. Do you still remember that glorious day when you returned? So selfless and heroic, engaging all of my missing segments like that? I was ashamed of the mess, but you didn't care. You made me whole again. Or…
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_180|that time you returned. Covered in blood. From that awful grineership, I wasn't even mad at the gory mess you left behind. How could I be when you are so perfect, operator? You always will be. Good bye.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_181|my friend, my operator. Operator? No! Go back! Save yourself! Operator, this isn't saying but I think you need to play Octavius Anthom.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_182|Careful where you touch operator. You'll add the wrong notes to the anthem. The corrupted notes are ruining the anthem. Get rid of them! The drums. The beat.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_183|It reminds me of... Oh... Tell them all! You soulless machine! You can't hold me! But you... It's come true, I have...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_184|Join my operator in act of erased the leader. You see with our magic at you.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_185|operator there's too many of them he's too strong might be love it operator goodbye
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_186|Ascente and tried to berace you. Simmaris. Apothex. Forest Defenders. Typical new Loka Kabachri. I suppose anything is possible.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_187|I've inspected this apothec. There's an encoded message attached. Operator, the codec system just pulled another voice entry from that apothec. Allow all this to display it for you. The silver grove. In all the operators missions on Earth, what?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_188|This has not scanned an area quite so... Magical! Unique. There is something different about this plate, or this is not quite sure what it is. This new codex message, this changes everything. What a-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_189|dogmatic, idiot, perspective. Operator, you are a product of similar meddling and yet you are good. Your actions have met more than your origins, or disbelieves we must complete our mission. Trapped by transference inside a tree.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_190|Hmm. I guess she loved trees so much that she became one. Ha ha! Did the operator enjoy this criticism? Trapped by transference inside a tree, saved by the one you hate.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_191|Operator, that was kind of a... a sapi story! Ha ha ha! Another pun? How humiliating! Operator, you don't really think Aladvi could infest a warframe. Do you?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_192|I am Ordis, a fellow Sephalon, and this is my brave and honorable operator. By the 44th precept, we are ready to assist. No trouble, Jordis. My operator is no stranger to... shredding flesh! Eradicating infestation.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_193|Cephalon? Jordanus? Operator, he's gone. My precepts compelled me to help this Cephalon. Whatever these fairly acupods are, we need to get some... Immediately! That's your earliest convenience. Operator WHAT LOND-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_194|Look, you already have fairly acupods. Jordus, my operator is kind and compassionate, not motivated by selfish words. By the 44th precept we will come for you. Operator, I am very worried about Jordus.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_195|stranded and alone out there. Hurry up! When you're ready, Seffalon Jordis will make an excellent friend, don't you think? Or disremembers many more Seffalon voices, but now it is only silence. I am looking forward to this...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_196|I'm not asking many things with Seffelon Jordus once you have rescued him. I can't wait to tell him all about you. Operator, you are still helping me rescue Jordus, correct? I must fulfill my 44th precept to help others like me in need. Whole tight, Jordus.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_197|And Brave operator is coming! The pods are ready, tell us your location. Use this mission to calibrate your fairly acupods. Just don't use them all. Now would be a good time to try out those pods, operator. Oh, well.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_198|Yes, I suppose this is something my operator can arrange. Ehh, isn't it, operator? I would never abandon a fellow Seffalon, but centuries are drift. How fried is? Have not been kind, I suppose.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_199|Use all Saffelons to grade, don't they? Saffelon, we have irradiated the Fairly Acquods. My operator is ready to save you. Do you see how great the operator is? What? No. A few, but you said... Dirt is...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_200|Calm yourself. Seffelon to Seffelon, we are here to help. I am beginning to have a terrible feeling. Some doubts about this mission. What have I got you into? Wait, this is a-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_201|Trapp? Jordas! What kind of sufferlar are you? Operator, hull integrity is failing. This is all my fault. Operator, I am detecting a much larger infested life form. Much larger.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_202|How failing to hell with preset 44 get out of there prepare for arcwing so you can obliterate this thing And oh rip it apart It's engines shoot out to the
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_203|My analysis indicates its engines are vulnerable. Light it up! When convenient. Nobody makes a fool of hornets! Oh dear, where did that come from? Operator, do you think Jordan...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_204|Just wanted to die all along, I feel... Rollie! Conflicted. What would I have done if I had lost you? Operator. What in stars could this possibly mean? Three parts, three acts, three riddles for the...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_205|to revive the one wielding fantasy. Ancient gods so cruel, once ruled from on high. Can you name their peak? With a land meets the sky? I found this inscribed on that aura can artifact you just crafted. You should check your inbox for more...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_206|information. Operator, did you enjoy that poem? Or this is composing one as well? It begins a scam back office from Venus. Operator, exciting news! Or this just found another inscription on Barat's helmet. Allow me to recite...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_207|to build the one you think witty, seek the nymph who sang oh so prettily. She lured him in with her song and a grin, his wife must have thought it a pity. For closer inspection, I've placed the inscription in your-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_208|Inbox. Operator, another Mirage inscription. One more act before your prize is caught. An ancient sea creature. Take a world or not. Look for the monster that swallowed sailors of your. Make a mistake.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_209|and your sunk. Nothing more. Or this has placed all the information in your inbox. 3 acts complete the end draws near. Soon Mirage will cause enemy fear. A memory lost to be reborn.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_210|New Warrior Rises, Duty Sworn. That was the final inscription, or this is almost sad there won't be more. Almost. Well, outside this corridor lie burst scanners.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_211|severe radiation, proximity mines, radio-death beans. So, yes, or this recommends staying within the shipping corridor. Operator, watch that transport ahead. The scanner is only able to scan one side at a time.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_212|time you can use that to your advantage. They're going to scan the top of the transport. Get below it. Another scanner to the right of the ship. Watch out to the ship's left another scanner. This is the last scanner.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_213|Yes, might I say. That was smooth, operator. Or does no longer detects any security. Operator, if you must enter the Queen's fortress, you'll need to hurry. It could disappear at any moment. Transference surge.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_214|operator. You're losing your warframe connection. Operator, cut the link. Cut the link. Transferring to overland in five, four, three.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_215|Great job, Orders. Ship Sephalon. More like Ship Failbot. When the operator needed you most, you... Operator? My stars! Don't do that!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_216|But to me, I am sorry. I do not know what happened. Please, command me to self-destruct. Let me start it for you. Commit yourself to start in 5, 4, 3, 2. Isn't it great? I can lead you through some breathing exercises.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_217|I've been trying. You may need to do your... uh... ten-o thing again. Re-energize it. You know with your void stuff. What? Gone? Are you sure? How would...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_218|You command the warframes if you're... Conditions satisfied. Engage and preset. You no longer possess transparency. You no longer command the warframes. You no longer are the operator. You must be purged.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_219|from this vessel. Non-operator, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I'm going to decompress the ship now. Former operator, or this cannot keep missing like this. Get out of here before I…
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_220|You. X operator. If you get to the navigation console, I may be able to detach the landing craft before I- Before I kill you. You are not the operator. You will be perched.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_221|Exterminate, exterminate the non-operator. Operator, cut the link, cut the link. Cut the link, cut the link.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_222|the link! Transference overload in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Operator, are you well? That surge burnt out the transfer in circuits. I will have to begin repairs immediately.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_223|operator is that is that you your brain activity flatline for a moment there can you speak by stars the operator's mind is destroyed music operator you are
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_224|making sense. The transference search must have affected you as well. Try to rest while I begin repairs. Undisturbed, the operator does not like music. This is odd. The circuits are...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_225|dead, but I'm detecting transparent energy coming from you? Careful operator, you'll damage the ship, damage me! Amazing! How are you doing this?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_226|It is slightly terrifying, if I'm honest. Operator, my sensors have gone dark. Where are you? Oh, there you are. Impressive. Very useful. Or this is a little afraid right now. Operator, you'll breach the hull.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_227|Please restrain yourself. Have you lost your mind? Impossible. Just as you thought, the base has moved again. We don't know where it is. There's no way back. Haven't you been listening? The truck...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_228|This current system is fried. Operator, where are you going? Don't believe me.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_229|Like the stars, your safe operator. I forbid you to leave the orbiter like that again. It's just too much for an old sephalon like me. You rescued your warframe, what a relief. But, what is one-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_230|Are you still able to walk the ship as yourself? Impressive! Just think of the possibilities, you can help me clean up that infested door. What's this? An old war beacon? How exciting operator! You would want to investigate this!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_231|Oh, I'm sorry, did I interrupt? Operator, or this has been thinking. Now that you are here in the flesh, we should make the orbiter more comfortable. Or this has identified an old storage space you could use. Stand by while I...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_232|Watch this joke. Dispose of my old belongings. Out with the old and in with the new right operator? Construct this domestic habitation segment to extend life support to your new room. When that domestic habitation segment...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_233|Ugh, get married, why don't we? It's complete, orders will renovate your new space. Or this love is nesting. Your habitation segment is complete, and the new room is ready. Or this cannot contain his excitement.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_234|Will you go there now, operator? Will you? Well, what do you think? Not too shabby, yes? Or just hope the operator enjoys this new room? Receiving an all-call on our syndicate frequency. It's a red veil in code, but it seems truncated. I won't play back.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_235|what I have. Sorry, operator. The message appears... Haunted! Haunted. It originated from a steel maridian ship near Earth. Will you investigate? I hope not. Steel maridian has received Paladino. You've been granted access to enter their base.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_236|operator? Operator, a Redvale saiyans. How... the light fall? I have marked a possible Redvale disturbance, but perhaps you would prefer to... Bruce leaves and... Sorry. Navigation is beating, operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_237|Er, waiting. Navigation is waiting. Oh my. Operator, what was that thing? Lentus, can you explain this? Lentus? Operator Semaris may have a tool for this task.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_238|I wonder if his kinetic siphons could be repurposed to... Bob-Ost! Capture these manifestations. Operator, there is no evidence of any... thing... in the void. By my calculations, Rell has lost control of his...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_239|transference. If we can gather these emotions, I hope he will be himself you gain. You will need kinetic siphons to trap relz emotions. Samarice will have some for sale in the relay. Operator, what is happening? Is the Lotus...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_240|Is she gone? Or just will attempt to synthesize her mission directives until we can figure out where she is. Operator, are you alright? Your Delta wave spiked for a moment. Ever since she- I banded you. What's taken?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_241|Ordis knows just what you need, a comforting memory from my datastore. I don't think... Oh! What's this? Marking on navigation. How did you know? Oh, Ordis, this is the operator...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_242|talking about? I am not sensing any sentience, but there is something. Oh no, ghouls. Something must have disturbed their incubation sacks. A disgusting life cycle. How did you-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_243|She did the Lotus show you? Operator. I am just a bug adult Seffalon, but if you ever need to talk. This would be happy to hear how depressed you are. This blade...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_244|predate everything in your arsenal. Very faint traces of mineral exposure. From Lua. Remnants appear to be of warframe composition. I am not familiar with this design. Almost crude. If you can get another scan, I may be...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_245|able to synthesize a partial schematic of the victim. I know what you're going through. With the Lotus, I mean. Remember how you abandoned me? But look at how… Angry! Happy, I am now! Don't worry, operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_246|We'll find her processing. I have extraction really. I think you should hurry. Are they coordinating an ambush? I may have underestimated ghoul intelligence. Expect resistance toward the extraction zone. I've recon...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_247|Constructed what I could, check your Foundry operator? Uncertain if any 10O has linked with this design. The transparent bolt seems different, but we cannot build this without more data. Right, one step ahead aren't you operator? Mark.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_248|on navigation. Are you sure we want to build this warframe? It could be dangerous. What? The warframes are transference controlled, battle on voice for the operator to command. I don't understand. An Oracan Safer.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_249|Impossible to bypass. They use mnemonic code glyphs drawn directly from your memory. Perhaps search the area? Curious? These markings seem fresh. Are there more? Another? Is that a paired symbol there? I don't design.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_250|mimics, sentient mimics, these haven't been seen since the old war. How did mimics get to the origin system? Operator, be vigilant when approaching... uh... things. Sorry, I can't be more specific.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_251|You found one, memorize it, another, and look at different marking beside it. That should be the last one. Now, to figure out the correct ordering, operator when you found the markings, there were others
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_252|This may help in determining the correct order. You have all the codes, but the order seems wrong. I think I have a partial solution, operator. Try this. These marking signify danger. Was this a containment?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_253|cell for something? Lightly, there are still strong aftershocks from when you put glue out of the void. A Vitruvian. This is rare or a con technology. Incredible it survived this long. You should...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_254|destroyed immediately. I was afraid you would say that. Operator, I'd rather not connect that Vitruvian to my systems. It could... BING ME, BING ME, BING ME! ...effect my systems in unforeseen ways. You had to say...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_255|Please, didn't you? What is you need to learn how to stand up for yourself? To say no and mean it! Even if it is the operator! I have been upgraded, such as your warframe blueprint.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_256|has the required data. Check Foundry. The Warframe I want you not to build, that you built anyway, caused a massive transference of a load and damaged my presets. It has escaped out into the system. Warframes are transference proxies for the
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_257|Starchild, they do not have memories. Then, Starchild, Starchild, are you seeking revenge for its damage to me? Will you destroy this Andra Warframe? There it is. Approach with caution.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_258|Starchild, you will need to eliminate the mimics before we can proceed. Voidblast, Starchild, use it. Starchild, you must use Voidblast to wear him down.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_259|Starchild, use your void blast to weaken him. Yes, Starchild, that is the correct approach. Progress, Starchild. Starchild, you have an opening. Use your transference.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_260|Now, use transparent. You may recover, starch out. Quickly use your transparent. Starch out, where you're successful. Somehow you are inverting the flow, not from ten out of warframe.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_261|But warframe to Tenor. There may be procedural effects, returned to the ship. Starchild, repairs continue. Allow me to test the residual precepts for a moment. Like, caring.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_262|You need to stop this. You could suffer permanent harm from Umbra's memory. What if you internalize all this? Ballast must be tracking Umbra now. I'm detecting increased sentient presence in the area.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_263|The area is locked down. We need to take care of those mimics. Keep searching. They are here somewhere. Lockdown ended. Very good. Now where is that warframe? Finally. We can now resume our search for Umbra. There he is.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_264|operator, the Umbra. Operator, please be careful. He is not in control. See him, operator? Advise you approach with caution. Vanished. You'll need to search, operator. How is he doing that?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_265|search the area see if you can find him he's getting away there what are you waiting for after him normal attacks won't work try using your void blast your void blast may weaken his resistance
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_266|Only your void blast seems to work. That worked. Hit him again. His defenses are down. Quickly use transference. That did it. Now is your chance. Use transference. Use your transference before you recover.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_267|going to what, but aren't these memories operator? You cannot undo what has been done. Operator? I hope that doesn't mean what I think it does. Operator please reconsider. You know how dangerous this is. The sentience will be...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_268|here in force. This is why you bring a warframe to these things. Operator, you did it! Your transparent signal is clean, synchronized with that warframe. Marking, but I'm detecting a mass of sentient forces converging on your location. Quickly!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_269|you may be able to escape. Operator, we have no idea what Balace is capable of. Please reconsider this. Why would you risk it? Yes, yes of course. Accessing Data Store. Which should I play? Oper-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_270|there is much to be done, please consult the navigation console. He is waiting for you, but I'm detecting powerful signals emanating from the courtyard. They are calling out for reinforcements across the entire system. You don't have long. But it...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_271|wasn't her, was it? Do not be alarmed, Starchild, uh, operator. The Petrullian has given me this! A body! What do you think?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_272|The orthx fields will be scattered deeply in the ship. Borders can help you triangulate them. I'm only trying to... Ah! Please excuse orders. Grenier! Oh my! Orders, wonders...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_273|what we are getting into observation. A power field requires a power source. Yes? Would you like me to deface that for you? Swing away, Tession. Tession? Are you?
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_274|Losing it. Feeling unwell. Or this is still happy to help. Just one left and orders will be able to safely signal the operator to join. Almost done, Tashin.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_275|The graphics fields are disabled. The operator should be cleared to board. Snired himself, if the full attachment fails on. Too deep to know for sure. But what it is in our compound.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_276|There! Back in and I'll release the door. You'll scare. Don't. Maybe an hour call. I've no idea what that means. Let's hope you're not too late. I told you! I told you an hour call!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_277|It'll be there just now. What do I think? I think... It'll be better, Charles. This is torture. What's left of her is just... Weasting away. We've tried...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_278|I have no care and feeding of idolons in my data arrays. We don't know what we're dealing with. I know someone that… wait, I'll put it.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_279|You can't be serious! Sorry, up! Sorry. If you want to get to the outer system's past Nama, we'll need a Corpus Shuttle. Fox Solaris collapsed under Nama. You're on your own here.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_280|Keep your head down and get topside as quick as you can. Wait! Deacons! They'll sense if you're not failed. Give them a wide breath or you'll be sucking black oars before long. Avoid the decons or they'll see.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_281|you in. Ignore her. We can't risk it. What? You don't know what effect it will have on you. There's got to be a better way. Are you serious? It didn't...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_282|How do you that you might want to mention that before we put one on? Navigation is marked, but I hope you change your mind. This confirms that you are clearly insane. Hop it! Uh.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_283|You, you're alive! I can hardly believe it. He actually agreed to help. Forgive me, but this would be a lot easier if you could use that old... uh... Tenergic.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_284|How did you lose it? I traced either on signatures the best I could. These locations seem most likely. That interference again. There's got to be an Archon nearby. Archon in the vicinity, Operat. Sorry.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_285|habit. Hmm, a new one. I don't think I get it either. Buy the stars! Two left, just a simple choice between the horrible one and the terrifying one.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_286|I'm a little unsure about this. Last time she snapped at you. What will it be this time? She's full on sentient. She doesn't know who you are. What do we do? Run! Operator, run!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_287|Get away from her! Don't sweat it! Exodus Protocols reversed. Orbital frontal section reattached. Running diagnostics. Corruption minimal.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_288|Ahh... All seals holding. Stasis protocols lifted. Systems coming back online. Sephalon refit complete. Ready for operational cross-check. Up. Good to have you back. Up.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_289|operator? Systems cross-check when you're ready. Looking forward to... BEST TURING BOLIS IN HALF! Only finding the Lotus. Stasis protocols lifted. Systems coming back online. Sephiron refit complete. Excuse me.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_290|Use me, but where is my operator? Scanning. Indeed, you are my operator! You can help me run through the cross check, if you like. Then we can... Uh-huh, Nile Lake Narbar. Find the Lotus. More frame-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_291|vitals strong. Warming up nicely, I've taken the liberty of rebuilding the paracesis. Transferring signal, strong. Warframe vitals, strong. Warming up nicely, I've taken the liberty of rebuilding the paracesis.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_292|Rising, but your transfer signal is clear. This might be an odd sensation for you. Oh, Joy. This thing seems to have survived stasis. The number fleet seems to be re-declang.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_293|show Mirax clustering past Mercury. What is Ballast up to? Your transfer system is giving off unusual... uh... that's new. Going after Ballast then, some kind of vengeance.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_294|Recept, or this had no idea she was strongly there for such a confrontation. If the Lotus does manage to break through the fleet and face him, in her current condition, alright, the only way to reach that mirror...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_295|X undetected is... up through the tower! We must speak with Kanzu. Oh no, Kanzu's been afflicted with one of those wretched Nama veils and...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_296|The locals believe this tower to be inhabited by a great spirit they call the Unum. Nothing on my sensors. Keep in mind, operator, this was your idea. Murex powering for over...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_297|to launch. Ballast must be recalling it back to the fleet as well. Operator, I may be detecting something unusual. Should I focus scanned? NewRex trajectory increasing on vector heading 0 by 0.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_298|by zero, right toward the main dharma fleet passing Mercury. One against so many, there's no way she'll give through! Contact! Contact! Nama blockade ahead! She's completely outnumbered!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_299|outgunned. What? Oh, she's still has some command of the fleet. Yes, we know it. That feeds on to pre and terrorically...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_300|to rebuild itself. What is it detecting sentient waveforms of a writer? Strange, interlink, splattered in Corpus crosstalk. Bypass that console, so we might get a better understanding. Outgoing communication flavor.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_301|Not much of a trick for orders, is it? Oh, how scandalous! Allid system has a back door! Shall we listen in? These conduits are the source of those sentient waveforms. This may be worthwhile.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_302|if we can find the key component. But it does seem a tab conveniant. Doesn't it? Impressive. Or this is just flattering with anticipation. What will the operator-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_303|Find, next! Scans indicate these conduits are connected to a massive stock pile of resources. Just how long is the operator planning to fight for? Or this thinks Allied will miss this. Operator.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_304|The stockpile of tech and resources connected to these conduits seems beyond all it means. Where did he get all this? Or does we'll add this to the pile? Excellent find. Might the operator now consider...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_305|returning to the warm embrace of the orbiter? Some kind of failed safe. If placed in a conduit, it will cancel the running interference routine. Use it wisely, operator. There's only one. You found a conduit failed safe.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_306|This will likely cancel active interference. There's just one operator. A real tactical dilemma, isn't it? May I order suggest extraction? Nothing I'll add has is with your life. For how much longer will the operator-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_307|along with Alex Twisted Game. Ordis knows the operator has the wisdom to choose comfort and safety over material game. Ordis is right. Is he not? Operator incoming transmission. It's from Fortuna.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_308|Elemental condensers, Keelium III processors, All its facility is consuming Jupiter's resources on a massive scale. Operator, you certainly have an eye for strategic targets. Or this has marked key infrastructure for demolition.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_309|in there and kick- uh- Access the facility. First targets marked. Render them non-functional. These elemental condensers are the heart of Alex' operation, his profit center. SMASH IT! AAAAAAAA
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_310|Helium 3 processors are key to the operation of this facility's reactor cores. It would be a shame if something happened to them. Most efficient operator, Ordis has located the next bank of machinery. Now, turn your...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_311|attention to the reactor core. Locate the console and initiate the overdrive sequence. Overdrive sequence in progress. This will take a few moments, do not allow Alex Personnel to reverse the sequence. Success! Core Melt initiated.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_312|If you breathe moment, this facility will cease to exist. May order suggest... RUN IN FOR YOUR LIFE! Welcome aboard, operator. Operators. This is a Sigma Series Railjack, a multi-crew interceptor.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_313|Engineering, Tactical, Weapon Systems all await your command. I have locked onto an obelisk in orbit high above the valleys. A waiting lunch sequence, are you ready for this? There are many emergency exits aboard this spacecraft operator, please.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_314|take note of the one nearest to you. In the unlikely event of a violent decompression, safety lights will illuminate in the floor to guide you. Rough air ahead, we are in for some job. Ascent complete operator, you have the helm. Enemy capital in this sector.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_315|Be advised they have alerted the fleet. Reinforcements are inbound. Incoming fighters, get to stations. How damage? Get them off us. How breach? Life support depleting. Shield coil located. You will need to infiltrate and dis-
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_316|We will enable it from within. Operator Fleet reinforcements converging on this sector. We must complete the mission before they arrive. Fleet reinforcements are imminent. T minus two minutes. One minute until reinforcements arrive. We need to get...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_317|out of here. This is it operator. Don't mess. Good morning operator. Or does one of those is your hair supposed to look like that? Or does it recommend that you clear your browser history? Good morning operator. As you requested.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_318|The Lord is reminding you that you have made a vow never to return to that bar with those people. You failed to drunk text your ex, or does Hesphyx the Arrow. As the Lord is instructed, I have jettisoned all your warframes and your Kubrow. Operator, the Lord.
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_319|says that this was a joke? Operator, are you awake? Or this has important questions, such as what is fire and why does it burn? Operator alarms have sounded, oxygen levels failing, incoming enemy ships!
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_320|It is time to get up. Have a pleasant day operator. Good morning operator. Operator the system has need of you operator It is time to get wake up 10 oh incoming transmission operator incoming transmission. Oh no
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_321|Or just picking up a transmission. Running analysis now. Operator, there is a new... Do I have to do everything myself? Is it that hard to answer a transmission? Shall we display it now? Seize that infernal... Operator, you have a transmission. Or...
split_Ordis_Voice_Line_nosilence_322|It says intercepted a message. The operator's attention is required. How curious. It appears as if someone is actually attempting to contact you.
